#============================================================================

# This file is formatted similar to the MIAConfig file.
# Create a commented line using the '#' character. 
# Comments must be on their own line.
# This file must be of the proper format to work with MIA.
# Create a combination name using 'SEQUENCENAME=name'.
# Define the timing between sequence parameters with 'timing=3000', units are milliseconds.
# After declaring a name for the command sequence, define the command sequence using the following.
# XXXX,YYYY=LEFTCLICK
# type=abc
# The first performs a left click at some coordinate (XXXX,YYYY).
# The second simply types 'abc'.
# Do not include spaces unless within a string variable. 
# Actions and program variables should be capitalized.
# The sequence name must be defined at the start of a sequence.
# The end of a sequence must be defined by ENDOFSEQUENCE.

# This combination is for testing.
