# Description : Different workouts with weighted values for MIA workout generation.
#============================================================================

# Create a commented line using the '#' character.
# This file must be of the proper format to work with MIA.

# To define a workout give it a name and a weight value (input as a double).
# units are added by placing a semicolon after the exercise followed by the unit name.
# This is done as such 'workoutName = weightedValue; unitName', for example 'pull_up = 5.0; reps'.
# All workouts are weighted relative to each other and the toughness value.
# Meaning, if one had 'pull_up = 5.0', then MIA would expect the user to be able to do 5.0 pull ups per unit toughness.
# toughness is the value that determines the difficulty.

# The toughness is defined by a user value 'toughness' which defaults at 1.0. 
# Increasing this value provides a global increase to difficulty. Recommended value is 1.
# Put this variable before all workout variables.
toughness = 1.0
